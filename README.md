Introduction

The Gesture Control Smart Board System is an innovative tool designed to facilitate digital interaction through hand gestures. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit to create a virtual smart board that can be controlled without physical touch. It enables users to draw shapes, lines, and write text using hand gestures, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Features

Gesture-based Drawing: Use hand gestures to draw lines, shapes, and text on the virtual board.

Shape Recognition: Automatically detect and correct shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles.

Line Smoothing: Automatically correct and smooth hand-drawn lines.

Virtual Math Calculator: Perform basic mathematical operations with hand-drawn symbols and digits.

Air Canvas Mode: Draw in the air and see the output on the digital canvas.

Screenshot Capture: Save your creations directly from the board.
